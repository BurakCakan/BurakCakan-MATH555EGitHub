    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split your dataset as train and test subset. But make sure that each test set contains exactly one random image from each distinct individual. This means, you will have to write your own train_test_split function for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Construct an SVM model on your train set, and test its accuracy on your test set. For this part, the images viewed as integer vectors of length 4096 are independent variables while the id number of the person that picture belongs to is the dependent variable. In other words, you are trying to construct an SVM model that recognizes individuals based on their pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Repeat Step 2 ten times.\n",

    "4. Calculate the mean accuracy and get 95% confidence interval using the t-test.\n",
